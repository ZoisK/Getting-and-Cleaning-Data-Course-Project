This data set provides the average value for a subset of the original measured data set (described in detail in UCI HAR Dataset)
For each individual of the 30 volunteers (as identified by the "Subject.ID") performing each of the 6 activities (as identified by the "Activity") 
the average value of 66 different measured quantities is given. 
The measured quantities are listed below. Since the original data were normalized and bounded in [-1,1] so are the average values given in this reduced data set. 

# Indexing Columns

*  "Subject.ID" 
    - identifies the individual volunteer, values are of the form Subject.<nn>, where <nn> is a 2-digit number ranging from 1 to 30 for the 30 volunteers

 *  "Activity"                                             
    - identifies the particular activity, values are {WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING}
